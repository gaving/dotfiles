==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*grex-introduction*

*grex* is a Vim plugin to provide useful commands to operate on lines matched
to the last search pattern.  For example, suppose you edit the following
content:
>
	#950 bugfix: jump behavior
	#923 bugfix: vs fold
	#930 enhancement: foldlevel adjustment
	#927 todo: release
	#926 enhancement: performance
	#924 enhancement: completion
	#931 bugfix: syntax highlighting
	#928 enhancement: key mappings
<
Once you search for a keyword such as "bugfix:", you can yank all lines
matched to the search pattern with |:Grey|.  After executing |:Grey|, you can
put the following text:
>
	#950 bugfix: jump behavior
	#923 bugfix: vs fold
	#931 bugfix: syntax highlighting
<
There is another command |:Gred| which deletes matched lines instead.

This plugin also provides functions and operators to do the same processes as
|:Gred| or |:Grey|.  See |grex-functions|, |grex-key-mappings| and
|grex-commands| for the details.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later

Optionals:
- |operator-user| 0.0.5 or later (vimscript#2692)

==============================================================================
BUGS						*grex-bugs*

						*grex-bugs-A*
(A) It's useful if |grex-commands| and |grex-functions| accept an argument
which is a search pattern to specify what lines to operate.  But they aren't
so.

						*grex-bugs-B*
(B) See also |operator-user-bugs| on problems which are related to
|grex-operators|.

						*grex-bugs-C*
(C) Delete operations don't update "0 (|quote0|), so that |:Gred| and other
operations should not do so, but they do.

						*grex-bugs-D*
(D) |grex-commands| don't support register designation unlike |grex-functions|
and |grex-operators|.




==============================================================================
CHANGELOG					*grex-changelog*

0.0.1	2009-09-08T13:06:06+09:00		*grex-changelog-0.0.1*
	Feature enhancements:
	- Add |:Gred|, |grex#delete()| and |<Plug>(operator-grex-delete)|.
	- Support register designation for |grex-operators|.  |operator-user|
	  0.0.5 or later is required to use this feature.
	- Support register designation for functions |grex-functions|.

	Minor improvements:
	- Revise the document.

	Incompatible changes:
	- Rename the plugin as "grex".  The old name "grey" is not proper for
	  further enhancements.
	- Rename all commands, functions and key mappings.
